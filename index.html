                    <p>Making a good Welcome Page isn’t an arduous journey—but it does take some work and effort to get it right.

                        Designers need to learn how to make a good welcome page that gives users what they want at the first sight. What users see on their first sight is a critical step during the onboarding period, as this is when the new users will make a decision if you can follow through on the promises you made on your homepage, or if they will leave. If the experience on your app/website meets or lives up to their expectations, they'll stay on your website; If not, they'll quit and choose other websites/apps. This article will explore some top examples and best practices to optimize your Welcome Page design and improve your conversion rate.</p>
